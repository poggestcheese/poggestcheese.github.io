# Hello, welcome to my personal website!

## Here, you'll find:
- Some wacky structures and styling (I currently push unstable code straight to the main branch lol)
- My projects
- A bit about me

This website lets me make projects specifically using HTML, CSS and JS so I can make projects on it!

## Things I want to add to the website
- A blog
- Stuff about me
- A functioning nav bar and stuff

## Projects I want to make
- Some sort of copy of infinite craft lol (maybe with elements and stuff)
- Infinite captchas for free robux, the more you do the wackier it gets
- a better version of journey planner
- A countdown app for iOS because the current ones suck
